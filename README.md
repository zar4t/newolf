## Project Description

**Newolf** is a cloud-native, multi-tenant platform that stores and manages
secrets and credentials for client organizations.

The project demonstrates applied cloud security and DevSecOps practices
through a real system — built while studying, not after. Every component is
designed with a threat model first, then implemented, attacked in a controlled
lab, and defended.

The project demonstrates:
- Threat modeling before implementation (STRIDE, PASTA, Attack Trees)
- Multi-tenant isolation and least-privilege access control
- Secrets management with encryption at rest
- Audit logging and detection engineering
- Infrastructure as Code with security scanning
- CI/CD pipelines with integrated security gates

## Current Status

Newolf is in its foundational phase. Security design comes first: the threat
model, project charter and purple team rules are complete and committed before
any production code is written.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Threat model (STRIDE, PASTA, Attack Trees) | Complete |
| Project charter and scope | Complete |
| Purple team charter and lab rules | Complete |
| Architecture decision records | In progress |
| API implementation | Not started |
| Infrastructure as Code | Not started |
| CI/CD pipeline | Not started |

## Security Model

Security is designed before code, not added after. The current threat model
covers six STRIDE categories and two full attack scenarios, documented in
[`docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`](docs/THREAT-MODEL.md).

| Principle | How it applies |
|---|---|
| **Least privilege** | Every identity gets only what it needs |
| **Tenant isolation** | No tenant can reach another tenant's data |
| **Defense in depth** | Multiple independent layers, no single point of failure |
| **Auditability** | Every sensitive action is logged and attributable |
| **Zero trust** | Authorization enforced server-side on every request |

## Architecture

The core flow of a request to store a secret, as decomposed during threat
modeling. Every step exists for a reason and maps to a specific threat.
```
Client
│
▼
[1] API receives the request
│
▼
[2] Authentication ── who is this?
│
▼
[3] Authorization ── are they allowed to do this?
│
▼
[4] Input validation ── is the payload well-formed?
│
▼
[5] Encryption ── secret is encrypted before storage
│
▼
[6] Tenant binding ── secret is tied to the correct tenant
│
▼
[7] Persistence ── written to secure storage
│
▼
[8] Audit log ── who did what, and when
│
▼
[9] Response to client
```

Steps 2 and 3 form the trust boundary: before them, a request is untrusted;
after them, it carries a verified identity and a defined set of permissions.

Detailed diagrams and design notes live in [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/).

## Architecture Decisions

Significant design decisions are recorded as ADRs (Architecture Decision
Records) in [`docs/architecture/adr/`](docs/architecture/adr/). Each record
captures the context, the decision itself and its consequences.

| ADR | Decision |
|---|---|
| [0001](docs/architecture/adr/0001-threat-model-before-code.md) | Threat model before writing code |

## Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| **API Core** | Python 3.12 (FastAPI) |
| **Data Layer** | PostgreSQL |
| **Containerization** | Docker |
| **Infrastructure** | Terraform, AWS |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions with security gates |
| **Security Scanning** | Trivy, Checkov, SAST/SCA |
| **Observability** | OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana |
