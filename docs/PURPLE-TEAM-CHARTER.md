# Newolf — Purple Team Charter

**Phase:** 00 — Research & Environment Charter
**Owner:** Luan Thales
**Status:** In progress

---

## Mission

The Purple Team exists to engineer resilient systems by building, challenging,
measuring, and continuously improving every security control. Every attack is
an experiment, every finding becomes knowledge, and every lesson strengthens
Newolf.

---

## Objectives

- Build a safe and controlled laboratory to simulate realistic attacks against Newolf.
- Validate that every security control works as expected under real attack scenarios.
- Measure the effectiveness of prevention, detection, response, and recovery mechanisms.
- Document every experiment with evidence, metrics, lessons learned, and technical conclusions.
- Transform every identified weakness into a concrete engineering improvement.

---

## Scope

**In Scope**
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Multi-tenant isolation validation.
- Secret management and access control.
- API security testing.
- Threat model validation through controlled attack simulations.
- STRIDE-based attack scenarios.
- Attack tree validation.
- Security logging and audit trail verification.
- Detection and response validation for implemented security controls.
- Documentation of every experiment, including evidence, metrics, and lessons learned.

**Out of Scope**
- Production environments.
- Third-party systems or services.
- Real attacks against public infrastructure.
- AWS infrastructure security assessments (not yet implemented).
- Kubernetes security testing (not yet implemented).
- CI/CD pipeline security validation (not yet implemented).
- Container security assessments (not yet implemented).
- Infrastructure-as-Code security validation (not yet implemented).
- Load, stress, or performance testing unrelated to security.
- Any activity outside the authorized Newolf laboratory environment.

## Tools

The Newolf Purple Team will use industry-standard tools to build, validate,
and improve the platform's security. These tools will be introduced gradually
as the project evolves. The goal is not to collect tools, but to understand
why each one exists, when it should be used, and what evidence it can produce.

All experiments will be performed only in authorized and controlled Newolf
laboratory environments.

**Red Team**
These tools help simulate how an attacker would think and act.

- Burp Suite — Test APIs and web applications for authentication, authorization,
session management, and input validation issues.
- Pacu — Explore AWS attack paths and validate cloud security controls.
- Sliver / Mythic — Study post-exploitation techniques and Command & Control behavior.
- Nmap — Discover hosts, services, and the exposed attack surface.
- OWASP ZAP — Perform automated security testing for web applications and APIs.

**Blue Team**
These tools help understand what is happening, detect suspicious activity,
and validate defensive controls.

- Falco — Detect suspicious runtime behavior.
- Tetragon — Observe security events using eBPF.
- Sigma — Create portable detection rules.
- Wazuh — Monitor hosts, collect logs, and generate security alerts.
- Suricata — Monitor network traffic and detect malicious activity.

**Purple Team**
These tools connect attack and defense, helping validate whether security
controls really work.

- Atomic Red Team — Simulate MITRE ATT&CK techniques in a controlled way.
- MITRE ATT&CK Navigator — Map attack coverage, detections, and security gaps.
- Caldera — Automate adversary emulation and validate defensive visibility.

**Cloud & Infrastructure**
These tools will become part of the laboratory as the cloud environment is built.

- Trivy — Scan containers, dependencies, and Infrastructure as Code.
- Checkov — Validate Infrastructure as Code security.
- Prowler — Assess AWS security posture.
- Kube-bench — Check Kubernetes against CIS Benchmarks.
- Kube-hunter — Identify weaknesses in Kubernetes environments.

**Supporting Tools**
Some tools will support automation, testing, observability, and evidence collection.

- Postman / Newman — Validate APIs through repeatable requests and automated collections.
- Custom Python scripts — Automate experiments and security validation.
- OpenTelemetry — Collect traces, logs, and metrics.
- Prometheus & Grafana — Measure and visualize experiment results.
- Wireshark / tcpdump — Analyze network traffic during experiments.

This list is not final. As Newolf grows, new tools may be added and others
may be replaced. Every tool must have a clear purpose, support a real
experiment, and help produce measurable security improvements.

## Laboratory Rules

1. **Every experiment must have a clear objective before it starts.**
   If I cannot explain what I am trying to validate, then I am not ready
   to run the experiment.

2. **Only authorized Newolf laboratory environments may be used.**
   No experiment will be executed against production systems, third-party
   services, or infrastructure outside the defined scope.

3. **Every experiment must be reproducible.**
   The steps, tools, configurations, and results must be documented so
   the experiment can be repeated and verified later.

4. **Evidence is mandatory.**
   Logs, screenshots, metrics, traces, and technical notes must be
   collected whenever they help explain what happened and support
   the conclusions.

5. **Every failure must produce learning.**
   If an experiment exposes a weakness, it must result in documentation,
   corrective actions, or improvements to the architecture, code, or
   security controls.

6. **Security experiments must never create unnecessary risk.**
   The objective is to understand, validate, and improve the system —
   not to cause damage or instability.

7. **No experiment is considered complete until its results are analyzed
   and documented.**
   Running a tool is not the goal. Understanding the outcome and turning
   it into engineering knowledge is.
